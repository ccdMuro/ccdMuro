# Moving on

I'm moving my FOSS code from Github to [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/muro)

Here's the post from [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/) that encouraged me to do so.

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS). I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop FOSS projects. 
I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.
